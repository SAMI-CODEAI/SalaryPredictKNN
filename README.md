# SalaryPredictKNN ðŸ’µ

## Overview
SalaryPredictKNN is a machine learning project that uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm to estimate salaries based on features such as experience, education, or job role. This project aims to provide a simple and effective tool for predicting salary ranges, useful for job seekers, employers, or HR professionals.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles cleaning and preparation of salary-related datasets.
- **K-NN Algorithm**: Implements K-Nearest Neighbors for accurate salary predictions.
- **Model Evaluation**: Includes metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or RÂ² score to assess performance.
- **Scalable**: Easily adaptable to various datasets with numerical and categorical features.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SAMI-CODEAI/SalaryPredictKNN.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd SalaryPredictKNN
   ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```

## Usage
1. Place your dataset (e.g., `salaries.csv`) in the project directory. Ensure it includes features like years of experience, education level, and salary.
2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python salary_predict_knn.py
   ```
3. View the results, including:
   - Predicted salaries for test data.
   - Model performance metrics (e.g., MSE, RÂ²).
   - Visualizations of predictions (if implemented).

## Dataset
- **Format**: CSV file (e.g., `salaries.csv`) with columns for features (e.g., `years_experience`, `education_level`) and target (`salary`).
- **Example**:
  ```
  years_experience,education_level,salary
  5,Bachelor,60000
  10,Master,85000
  ```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`

## Project Structure
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `salary_predict_knn.py`: Main script for running the K-NN model.
- `salaries.csv`: Sample dataset (placeholder; user-provided).
- (Additional files, e.g., Jupyter notebooks, may be included for exploration.)
